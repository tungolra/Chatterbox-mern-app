# Next Steps:

Going forward, some early stage icebox additions we have planned include:

1. Allowing users to only be able to see accepted 'friends' as users in their user list!
2. A search function to be able to find specific messages that were sent at a previous time.
3. A function that allows both users to see when either user is typing.

Some later changes we would love for CHATTER[BOX] to have include:

1. Being able to change UI settings (chat colours, text colours, night mode, and accessbility settings for the visually impaired) for heightened user experience.
2. Allowing for the cropping of profile photos as a pleasant addition in making a personalized and individualized profile.
3. Allowing for users to create group chats with other users. Upon creation, a brand new and empty chat should render with a list of all the added individuals and a combination of their profile pictures as the group chat picture. User that are later added should prompt a message for all previously included users to see (ie. "Kendra Yoshizawa has been added to the group chat."). The newly added user should also not be able to see messages that were sent prior to their arrival for user privacy.
